title: Repository graph
---

The repository graph uses the [Raphael](https://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/) JavaScript library to render an SVG graph based on the passed-in data.

To work locally with the repository graph, you must use [Webpack](../troubleshooting/webpack.md) instead of Vite.
