title: Browse your development KhulnaSoft server
---

If you just want to browse your local KhulnaSoft installation this is the
quickest way to do it.

```shell
cd khulnasoft-development-kit
kdk start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. It
may take a few seconds for KhulnaSoft to boot in development mode. Once
the sign-in page is there, [get the login credentials](../kdk_commands.md#get-the-login-credentials).

You can shut down KDK in your terminal with `kdk stop`.
