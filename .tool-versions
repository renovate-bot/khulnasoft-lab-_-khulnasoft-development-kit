# NOTE: This file declares dependencies for KDK itself.
#
#       Each project KDK manages should define its own depenencies in
#       its respective repository, and not in here.
#
#       This file _can_ be used to override specific versions when
#       incompatibilities arise, but generally speaking, each project is
#       responsible for declaring its dependencies and KDK follows these
#       declarations.
